Research Interest
======
My research interest lies in security and privacy-preserving aspects of Machine Learning (ML). Specifically, I am broadly interested in developing methodologies to improve the reliability, trustworthiness and efficiency of various ML systems. I have conducted several research projects such as accurate and honest uncertainty estimates of ML algorithms, optimal balance of security and efficiency in ML systems and efficient encryption algorithm, etc. My efforts have led to publications in highly-competitive conferences such as ICA3PP.
